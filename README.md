This repository contains: data_scraping.py

This a Python script which uses Tweepy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Textblob.

The goal of this script is to scrape Tweets (Tweepy), handle the data (Pandas), 
perform sentiment analysis on them using Textblob (ie positive, neutral, negative) 
and display the results neatly and coherently using Matplotlib.

Unfortunately Tweepy has added cost to use their premium API, so as of right now I have set the number of Tweets analyzed
to only 25.
